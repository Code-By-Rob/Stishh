# Stishh Blog & Articles Website

## Stishh Overview

![alt text](/assets/Stishh-Media.png)

Stishh is a web application that allowed for selected users to upload articles and blog posts. It allows for users to upload images (stored in an s3 bucket) as well as gifs, facebook, instagram, twitter and other social media posts. This is a project that I built after I spent time focusing on developing my web dev skillset.

I built this website after studying the materials of [The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy (my certificate)](https://udemy-certificate.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/UC-c5fe8605-7137-4f37-8475-06c87260f98f.pdf), here is the link to the course and it's curriculum [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
